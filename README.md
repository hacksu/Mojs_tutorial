# Mojs Hacksu Tutorial
2/13/18

## Intro

MoJS is a graphics animation library for Javascript! This tutorial is just to give you the resources you need to get started. 

## Resources

We're going to be using Codepen to play with MoJS. MoJS is all about making things pretty, so we're going to start out with some basic styling. Either fork or copy the HTML and CSS from this codepen file into a new codepen file:

The other thing we're going to need is to add the MoJS libraries to Codepen! Just go into the JS panel, click the gear, and paste these links in the `External Resources` area (not the search bar). Here are the two links you need to add:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/mojs-player/0.43.15/mojs-player.min.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/mojs/0.265.6/mo.min.js

I'll also be live coding the whole thing! You can watch what I do here:
